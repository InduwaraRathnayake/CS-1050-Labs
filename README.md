## Lab Details

### Lab 3 - Ripple Carry Adder

This lab involved designing a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder by first creating Half and Full Adders. These basic components were then combined to form the RCA, with functionality verified through simulation and on a development board.

### Lab 4 - Combinational Circuits

This lab focused on designing two key microprocessor components: a 3-to-8 decoder and an 8-to-1 multiplexer. The functionality of both components was verified through simulation and implementation on a development board.

### Lab 5_1 - Multipliers

This lab focused on implementing multipliers for binary numbers, including the development of a 2-bit multiplier and its extension to handle 4-bit binary numbers. [Check Out Lab](https://github.com/InduwaraRathnayake/CS-1050-Labs/tree/4b2fda872d3fe80e1d83637954d41819c35aadf2/Lab%205_1)

### Lab 5_2 - Counter with External Input

This lab involved designing a 3-bit counter that counts in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions based on an external input. The functionality was verified through simulation and testing on a development board.

### Lab 6 - Arithmetic Unit

This lab focused on designing a 4-bit arithmetic unit capable of adding two numbers stored in registers. The tasks included developing a 4-bit register and the arithmetic unit, with functionality verified through simulation and implementation on a development board.

### Lab 7 - 7-Segment Display

This lab involved designing a 7-segment display for the 4-bit Arithmetic Unit developed in a previous lab. The tasks included creating a lookup table using Read Only Memory (ROM) and developing the 7-segment display based on this table. Functionality was verified and demonstrated through simulation and on a development board.

### Lab 8 - Assembly Programming

This lab focused on learning Assembly programming and interfacing simple input and output devices with a microprocessor. Tasks included developing Assembly programs to achieve specific objectives and integrating input/output devices. Functionality was verified through simulation.

### Lab 9 - Final Project - Nanoprocessor Design

This lab involved designing a 4-bit processor capable of executing 4 instructions. The tasks included developing an arithmetic unit for adding and subtracting signed integers, decoding instructions to activate processor components, and designing k-way b-bit multiplexers and tri-state buses. Functionality was verified through simulation and on a development board.
